# Exosite UI Code Challenge
A fun code challenge to build out a simple checkout UX.


## Installed NPM Packages:
- **react-dom**: Adds ReactJS compabilities within a Meteor app
- **react-mounter**: Flow Router for ReactJS Meteor app
- **meteor-random**: Love them randomized hex strings. :)
- **Other Installs**:
  - babel-runtime
  - meteor-node-stubs
  - meteor-random
  - react
  - react-addons-pure-render-mixin
  - underscore

## Additional Packages & Libraries:
- **Bootstrap 3**: Used a little bit of Bootstrap's library but also opt'ed to hand style a lot to demonstrate LESS/SASS knowledge.
- **Animate.css**: A Pure-CSS, fun, and super simple animation library.

## How we can run it
1. Install Meteor – `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
2. Clone repo to your local machine
2. `cd` into the `exosite-code-challenge` project
3. Install necessary npm packages – `meteor npm install`
4. Run application – `meteor`

## Describe any design choices and tools
- **Meteor**:  I went Meteor for 2 reasons:
1. There's a ton of out of the box wiring that Meteor does for you which is perfect with you're trying to code up a code challenge in one day that's backed by a database (MongoDB).
2. I wanted to demonstrate Meteor a bit more then their Todo app. ;)
- **Bootstrap 3**: HUGE fan of Material UI but for the sake of time I went with Bootstrap because I have this library memorized so it's quicker for me...for now. ;)


## Honestly assesses room for improvement
This has been a fun code challenge.
